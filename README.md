A website for a science museum designed to cater to primary and middle school children.

## Description

This project was my Semester Project 1 at Noroff. Where we were tasked to create a responsive website for a fictional science museum called Community Science Museum.

The goal was to use the knowledge gained from the previous courses during our first semester at Noroff. The site should cater to primary and middle school children, providing an informative and engaging experience.

**The site contains the following pages:**

- Home
- Explore

- Visit Us
- Get Involved
